Web performance is critical for user experience, SEO, and conversion rates. This guide covers everything you need to know to optimize your website's performance.

## Understanding Web Performance Metrics

Before diving into optimization techniques, it's important to understand what we're measuring. Key performance metrics include:

### First Contentful Paint (FCP)

FCP measures the time from when the page starts loading to when any part of the page's content is rendered on the screen. A good FCP score is under 1.8 seconds.

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

LCP measures the time from when the page starts loading to when the largest text block or image element is rendered on the screen. A good LCP score is under 2.5 seconds.

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

CLS measures the sum of all unexpected layout shifts that occur during the entire lifespan of the page. A good CLS score is under 0.1.

## Optimizing Image Delivery

Images often account for the largest portion of a webpage's size. Here's how to optimize them:

### Image Format Selection

Choose the right format for your images:
- JPEG: Best for photographs
- PNG: Best for images with transparency
- WebP: Modern format with better compression
- AVIF: Newest format with the best compression

### Responsive Images

Implement responsive images using the `srcset` attribute to serve different image sizes based on the user's device:

```html
<img 
  src="image-800w.jpg" 
  srcset="image-400w.jpg 400w, image-800w.jpg 800w, image-1200w.jpg 1200w" 
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 1200px) 800px, 1200px" 
  alt="Responsive image"
